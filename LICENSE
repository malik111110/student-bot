1. "Adapted Material" means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that
is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a
manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a

produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving
image.

2. "Adapter's License" means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

3. "Copyright and Similar Rights" means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and sui generis database rights, without regard to how the rights are
labelled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified
in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

4. "Effective Technological Measures" means those measures that, in the absence
of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations
under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and
similar international agreements.

5. "Exceptions and Limitations" means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

6. "Licensed Material" means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

7. "Licensed Rights" means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar
Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has
authority to license.

8. "Licensor" means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

9. "NonCommercial" means not primarily intended for or directed towards
commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public
License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to
Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is
NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in
connection with the exchange.

10. "Share" means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

11. "Sui Generis Database Rights" means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

12. "You" means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. "Your" has a corresponding meaning.

SECTION 1 — SCOPE

1.1. License grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
Licensed Material to:

(a) reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for
NonCommercial purposes only; and

(b) produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes
only.

1.2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and
Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not
need to comply with its terms and conditions.

1.3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 5.

1.4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known
or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You
from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
modifications authorized by this Section 1.4 never produces Adapted Material.

1.5. Downstream recipients.

(a) Offer from the Licensor — Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

(b) No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

SECTION 2 — LICENSE CONDITIONS

2.1. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
form), You must:

(a) retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

(ii) a copyright notice;

(iii) a notice that refers to this Public License;

(iv) a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; and

(v) a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

(b) indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of
any previous modifications; and

(c) indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2.2. NonCommercial. You may not exercise the Licensed Rights for commercial
purposes.

2.3. No additional restrictions. You may not apply legal terms or technological
measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

SECTION 3 — SUI GENERIS DATABASE RIGHTS

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
those rights to the extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License. To the extent the
Licensor's Sui Generis Database Rights survive this waiver, You may not use those
rights to prevent downstream recipients from exercising the Licensed Rights.

SECTION 4 — TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1. Term. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License,
then your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

4.2. Termination. Where Your rights under this Public License terminate due to a
breach, those rights may be reinstated at the Licensor's discretion if You cure the
breach within 30 days of becoming aware of it and notify the Licensor.

SECTION 5 — DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the Licensor offers the
Licensed Material as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

To the extent possible, the Licensor disclaims liability for damages arising out of
or in connection with the Licensed Material.

SECTION 6 — MISCELLANEOUS TERMS

6.1. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the
Licensed Material is, connected with, sponsored, endorsed, or granted official
status by the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution.

6.2. Severability. If any provision of this Public License is invalid or
unenforceable under applicable law, it shall be interpreted to the maximum extent
permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties; the remainder of this Public
License will remain in full force and effect.

6.3. Other terms and conditions. The Licensor and You may enter into separate
agreements that alter or add additional terms to this Public License. You should
adhere to the terms of any such agreements where they are applicable.
